elastic cloud compute (ec2)---->depend on 2 2major thins controller & compute
controller (back ground) comput(foreground)
It works as hypervisor(oracle virtual box ,vagrant ,vm)



Amazon2018.03.0

virtual private cloud

Never selecte terminate in shutdown behaviour (Instance will be deleted automatically) it should be in stop

Jenkins will listen on 8080(by default)
Apache tomcat (8080) apache (80)  https (443)


Once instance was created successfully we have to check for status checks  2/2 checks


sudo -i (it will switching account from user to root user)
 yum install httpd -y (yum yellowdog update modulur)
 
 
Redhat (we have systemctl status httpd)
linux (service httpd restart)

open 
http://52.14.15.155:80 (it throwed exception as we didnt mention 80 port in security instance)



It will automatically creates firewall settings

[root@ip-172-31-40-49 ~]# service firewalld status
firewalld: unrecognized service

 
passwd root

aCCOUNT Id 361267078331--->smallidi--->Sudha@118
MFA-->Multi Factor Authentication(To give high Security to user)--->CLick on username--->SecurityCredentials--->Download Google Authenticatoe & scan code

In organisation they will give device instaed of google authenticator

Without elastic we will use public key
With elastic Private Key


Difffercen btn rwdhat ubuntu
Ubuntu --->systemctl status apache2
Ubuntu version-->ubuntu@ip-172-31-19-173:~$ lsb_release -a

cat /etc/os-release


When we stop & start instance IP address will change automatically...To keep permanent IP we will make it throgu Elastic IP Address---
Elastic IP Address (Chargeble)--->We will allocate permanent IP address to our own instance (LINUX,UBUNTU)

Install  MySql workBench ( to install workbench visual c++

secure crt (C:\Users\sudha\AppData\Roaming\VanDyke\Config)


We should select easy create (standard Create) in real time environment
Select freetier in dbsize...
DB Size should be below 40gb

s3--->Bucket

TO store data or any files(photos images videos etc) we will use s3...Which all can be stored in HDD

Create Bucket---->
ENter bucketname--->sudhakar1218 (Its like gmail will check for universal ids and if its matching with same name it wont allow u to create)
and click next
Instead of KEy(name) value(sudhakar1220)
Block public access (Leave it for now) we can change post creation of bucket-->
Next and create buccket.

Click on Bucket Name--->Permissions--->edit and allow public access--->make public
Overview--->UPload file-->copypath and open URL---> It should open in browser once its opened to public...

Lambda: cahrgeble(FOr testing purpose and will create cloud watch & cloud trail)

Lambda--->Creata FUcntion--->Use a blue Print(We will use blue print in real time env)--->(Blue Prints info & select any one)
 
Function name-> SudhakarLambda--->create a new role--->Create function
Select a testevent(Configure test event) and run test ( It will display all code erros in output and will share them to Dev team)Its 100% accurancy and less time.
